Description

Design, implement, and experiment a placement algorithm with the following characteristics:                                                                      

The algorithm implements Timberwolf placement (placement using Simulated Annealing). 
The algorithm considers standard cell placement, e.g., all cells are placed in rows.
The algorithm minimizes the total IC area after placement.
The algorithm maximizes the expected routability of interconnect.
The algorithm minimizes the expected total interconnect length. 
 Program inputs:

The circuit netlist, area, position of I/O pins on the pad frame
Additional Requirements

You must decide the output / display of the placement results, e.g., a graphical procedure to display the results.
The feedback that is produced for unroutable nets to further guide the placement process.
